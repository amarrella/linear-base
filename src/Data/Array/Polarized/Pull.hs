-- XXX: the data constructor Pull.Array could be used unsafely, so we don't
-- export it, instead exporting a collection of functions to manipulate
-- PullArrays
-- (eg one could use an element multiple times, if the constructor was
-- available)
-- TODO: the current collection is almost certainly not complete: it would be
-- nice if there was one (or a small number) of functions which characterise
-- PullArrays, but I'm not sure what they are
-- In particular, PullArrays are incredibly unfriendly in returned-value
-- position at the moment, moreso than they should be
